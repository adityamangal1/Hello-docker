        <p>Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate
            your
            applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your
            infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies
            for
            shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code
            and
            running
            it in production.</p>

        <p class="second">Fast, consistent delivery of your applications

            Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments
            using local
            containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and
            continuous
            delivery (CI/CD) workflows.Dockerâ€™s container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker
            containers can run on a developerâ€™s local
            laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of
            environments. Check out the guide to install the docker <a

        <p class="third">The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When
            you use commands such as
            docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the
            Docker API.
            The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.When you use Docker, you are creating and using
            images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This
            section is a brief overview of some of those objects.A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can
            create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the
            Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create
            a new image
            based on its current state.
